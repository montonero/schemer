# Schemer

This is a minimalist scheme interpreter implemented in C++. The main purpose
of this project is educational.

It implements a subset of scheme specification, yet, is fully computational
capable (i.e. it's Turing complete)

## TODO

* Garbage Collector
* Tail call optimization

## Future features:

* Scheme macros
* Compiling option
